# POST Album Route Design Recipe

_Copy this design recipe template to test-drive a plain-text Flask route._

## 1. Design the Route Signature

_Include the HTTP method, the path, and any query or body parameters._

POST / albums
  title: string
  release_year: number (str)
  artist_id: number (str)

# Expected response (200 OK)
(No content)
```

## 2. Create Examples as Tests

_Go through each route and write down one or more example responses._

_Remember to try out different parameter values._

_Include the status code and the response body._

```python
# POST /albums
# Parameters:
#   title=Voyage
#   release_year=2022
#   artist_id=2
# Expected response (200 OK):
"""
(No content)
"""
```

## 3. Test-drive the Route

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._

Here's an example for you to start with:

```python
"""""
GET /home
  Expected response (200 OK):
  "This is my home page!"
"""
def test_get_home(web_client):
    response = web_client.get('/home')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.data.decode('utf-8') == 'This is my home page!'""

"""
POST /albums
  Parametes:
    title=Voyage
    release_year=2022
    artist_id=2
  Expected response:
    (No content)
"""
def test_albums(web_client):
    response = web.client.post('/albums', data={'title': 'Voyage' 'release_year': 2022 'artist_id': 2})
    assert response.status_code = =200
```
